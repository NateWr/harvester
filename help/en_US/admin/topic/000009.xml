		<![CDATA[<p>When creating a new crosswalk or editing an existing crosswalk, the Administrator will be given the opportunity to select the fields it links in the various metadata formats. (For a general description of crosswalks, see {help_topic key="admin.crosswalks" text="Crosswalks"}.)</p>
		<p>A single crosswalk may link several fields in several metadata formats. For example, in the MARC schema, author information is potentially spread amongst many fields; these can be grouped into a single crosswalk.</p>
		<p>It is not necessary for every crosswalk to support all schemas; if a crosswalk only supports a few schemas, it will only be displayed when it is relevant (based on the selected archives on the Search page).</p>
		<p>Crosswalks may be of two types: date crosswalks or text crosswalks. Note that some fields are "mixed-type", and may contain both text and date information; if so, that field will be selectable for both date crosswalks and text crosswalks.</p><p>Crosswalks maybe added, deleted, and modified without requiring a re-indexing of content.</p>]]>
