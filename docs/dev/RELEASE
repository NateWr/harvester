Harvester Release Procedure
---------------------

The following steps (subject to change) are typically performed to prepare a new
Harvester release:


1. Update version, installation, and upgrade descriptor files:

    dbscripts/xml/version.xml
    dbscripts/xml/install.xml
    dbscripts/xml/upgrade.xml


2. Update release documentation:

    docs/README
    docs/release-notes/README-<VERSION>


3. Generate ChangeLog for the release:

    see e.g. http://github.com/jwiegley/git-scripts/blob/master/git-changelog

4. Copy the current changelog and release notes to docs/:

    cp docs/release-notes/ChangeLog-<VERSION> docs/ChangeLog
    cp docs/release-notes/README-<VERSION> docs/RELEASE


5. After committing any pending modifications, tag the release in git (both the
Harvester codebase and the PKP library to be distributed with it):

	cd lib/pkp
    git tag harvester-<MAJOR>_<MINOR>_<REVISION>-<BUILD>
    cd ../..
    git tag harvester-<MAJOR>_<MINOR>_<REVISION>-<BUILD>
    git push --tags


6. Build the Harvester package and patch files:

    sh tools/buildpkg.sh <VERSION> <TAG> <PATCH_DIR>
    
    (<PATCH_DIR> is the path to a directory containing previous Harvester
    release packages against which to build patches)


7. Place the new package, patches, and version descriptor on the Harvester site:

    http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester2/download/
    http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester2/download/patch/
    http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester2/harvester2-version.xml
