   2) Can I modify the Harvester2 code?
   
A: As Harvester2 is an open source program, you are free to make any code
   changes that you like. We welcome any code submissions or patches to be
   posted on the Development Forum at <http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/> if
   you think your changes may be beneficial to other users.

   Please note that if you plan on redistributing Harvester2 (either in original
   or a modified form), you must do so according to the terms of the GNU General
   Public License v2. See docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.



===================================
Server Configuration and Management
===================================

   1) Will Harvester2 work with PHP as a CGI instead of as an Apache module?

A: Harvester2 is known to work reasonably well with PHP as a CGI using Apache's
   mod_actions. Since there are a number of different ways to configure Apache
   to use the CGI version of PHP (e.g., through FastCGI, etc.), your mileage may
   vary with other deployments (feedback is welcomed).

   On PHP 4 it may be necessary to add "cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1" to the server's
   php.ini to avoid fatal "No input file specified" errors. This parameter is
   enabled by default on PHP 5.
   
   Harvester2 may not function correctly if the base directory is located
   outside of the virtual host's DocumentRoot directory (e.g., when using
   mod_alias or mod_userdir). This is due to a bug/feature in the method PHP
   uses to determine the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable by stripping the
   DOCUMENT_ROOT from SCRIPT_FILENAME.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) Will Harvester2 work correctly in PHP's "safe mode"?

A: Harvester2 is known to work reasonably well with PHP's safe mode restrictions
   (including open_basedir) enabled. Testing has not been extensive, so there
   may be unknown issues, in particular with very restrictive configurations
   that disable PHP functions relied on by Harvester2 (feedback is welcomed).

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Will Harvester2 work in a Microsoft IIS environment, or on other
      non-Apache web servers?

A: While Harvester 2.x has not been tested on Microsoft IIS servers, it is based
   on the Open Journal Systems 2.x codebase, which has been tested on Microsoft
   Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0 on PHP 5.x. Additional standard environments
   should also be supported; we welcome feedback from users who have
   successfully installed and used Harvester2 in other server environments.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) How can I create a backup of a Harvester2 site?

A: It is recommended that a Harvester2 system be periodically backed up to
   guard against a failure in Harvester2 or the server software or hardware that
   could result in data loss.
   
   To properly backup a Harvester2 system, the following should be backed up:
     - The database, using the tools provided by your DBMS (e.g.,
       mysqldump for MySQL, pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
     - The base Harvester2 directory
       
   This backup procedure can be easily integrated into any automated backup
   mechanism.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) How can I move an existing Harvester2 installation to a different server?

A: To move a Harvester2 system from one server to another, you will need to:

   - Copy the database data, and import it into the new server (e.g., using the
     command-line tools provided by the DBMS)
   - Copy the base Harvester2 directory and non-public files directory
   - Update config.inc.php with any changed settings for the new server
     (typically, the base URL, database authentication/access, email, and files
     settings will differ between servers)



=======================
Common Technical Issues
=======================

   1) When I try to access my Harvester2 site this error message is displayed:
      "Warning: Smarty error: problem creating directory '/./templates' in
      ./lib/smarty/Smarty.class.php"

A: This can occur if a higher level directory has execute permission but not
   read permission. In these situations, the __FILE__ value in an included file
   appears to be relative to the location of the including file. This issue can
   be resolved by ensuring all parent directories are both readable and
   executable.

   See also this PHP bug report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16231>.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Emails sent out by the system are never received.

A: By default, Harvester2 sends mail through PHP's built-in mail() facility.

   On Windows PHP needs to be configured to send email through a SMTP server
   (running either on the same machine or on another machine).
   
   On other platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X, PHP will sent mail using the
   local sendmail client, so a local MTA such as Sendmail or Postfix must be
   running and configured to allow outgoing mail.
   
   See <http://www.php.net/mail> for more details on configuring PHP's mail
   functionality.
   
   Harvester2 can also be configured to use an SMTP server as specified in
   config.inc.php, either with or without authentication.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) I am using Apache 2.0.x, and Harvester2 pages fail to load, producing an
      error like "File does not exist: .../index.php/index/...".

A: With some versions or configurations of Apache 2.0.x, it may be necessarily
   to explicitly enable the AcceptPathInfo directive in your Apache
   configuration file.
   
   See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html for more information about
   this directive.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) Harvester2 installation fails with the MySQL error "Client does not
      support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading
      MySQL client".

A: This problem is caused by a change in the MySQL authentication protocol in
   MySQL 4.1, and can occur if your system is using an older MySQL client
   library with a newer MySQL server.

   See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html for suggested
   approaches to resolve this issue.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6) "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session
       module's ini settings at this time" messages appear when I load
       Harvester2.

A: Check if session.auto_start is enabled in your php.ini configuration.
   Harvester2 requires this setting to be disabled, which is the default
   behaviour in current versions of PHP.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   7) The installation form loads successfully, but after clicking the button
       to install, a blank page appears and the database was not created.

A: This may indicate that your server does not have the selected PHP database
   module installed and enabled (this can be verified by looking at the output
   of phpinfo() to see if the required database support exists -- see
   http://php.net/phpinfo).
   
   The Harvester2 installer lists database drivers for which the required PHP
   extension does not appear to be loaded in brackets (e.g., "[MySQL]").
   
   Most Linux distributions offer a separate package that can be installed for
   each supported PHP database module -- e.g., php4-mysql or php-mysql (for
   MySQL support), or php4-pgsql or php-pgsql (for PostgreSQL support).
   
   Note also that even with the module installed it may be necessary to modify
   your php.ini configuration to load the module, by adding "extension=mysql.so"
   or "extension=pgsql.so", for example.
