Upgrading a Harvester2 Installation
-----------------------------------

Note: backing up your current data files and database is strongly recommended
prior to upgrading Harvester2.

If you are using PHP Safe Mode, please ensure that the max_execution_time
directive in your php.ini configuration file is set to a high limit. If this
or any other time limit (e.g. Apache's "Timeout" directive) is reached and
the upgrade process is interrupted, manual intervention will be required.


============================
Upgrading from Harvester 2.0
============================

Upgrading to the latest version of Harvester2 involves two steps:

    - Obtaining the latest Harvester2 code
    - Upgrading the Harvester2 database

It is highly recommended that you also review the release notes (docs/RELEASE)
and other documentation in the docs directory before performing an upgrade.

Obtaining the latest Harvester2 code
------------------------------------

The Harvester2 source code is available in three forms: as patches against older
releases of Harvester2, from an anonymous CVS repository, and as a complete
stand-alone package.

Patching or updating from CVS are the recommended approaches if you have made
local modifications to the system.

1. Patch

Patch files for older releases of Harvester2 can be downloaded from the
Harvester2 web site.

To update by patching, download the appropriate patch file for your current
version of Harvester2 and run the following command from your Harvester2
directory:

    $ patch -p1 < PATCH_FILE

"PATCH_FILE" should be replaced with the path to the decompressed patch file
that was downloaded, e.g. "harvester-2.0_to_2.0.1.patch".

Alternatively, Harvester2 2.0.1 and later provide a command-line tool to
automatically download and apply the appropriate patch to upgrade to the latest
release. To use this tool run the following command from your Harvester2
directory:

    $ php tools/upgrade.php patch

Note that this will require the GNU patch tool to be installed. GNU patch is
included in most *NIX distributions, and is available for Windows and Solaris
as a download. Windows users may need to work around a patch bug by converting
the line-endings in the patch file from UNIX to DOS; to do this, open the patch
file in Notepad and save it again.


2. CVS

If your instance of Harvester2 was checked out from the PKP anonymous CVS
repository (see docs/README-CVS), you can update the Harvester2 code using a
CVS client.

To update the Harvester2 code from a CVS check-out, run the following command
from your Harvester2 directory:

    $ cvs update -r TAG

"TAG" should be replaced with the CVS tag corresponding to the new release.
Harvester2 release version tags are of the form
"harvester-MAJOR_MINOR_REVSION-BUILD". For example, the tag for the initial
release of Harvester2 2.0.1 is "harvester-2_0_1-0".

Consult the README of the latest Harvester2 package or the Harvester2 web site
for the tag corresponding to the latest available Harvester2 release.

Note that attempting to update to an unreleased version (e.g., using the HEAD
tag to obtain the bleeding-edge Harvester2 code) is not recommended for anyone
other than Harvester2 or third-party developers; using experimental code on a
production deployment is strongly discouraged and will not be supported in any
way by the Harvester2 team.


3. Full Package

It is also possible to upgrade by downloading the complete package for the
latest release of Harvester2:

    - Download and decompress the package from the Harvester2 web site
    - Make a copy of the config.inc.php provided in the new package
    - Move or copy the following files and directories from your current
      Harvester2 installation:
        - config.inc.php
        - public/
    - Replace the current Harvester2 directory with the new Harvester2
      directory, moving the old one to a safe location as a backup
    - Be sure to review the Configuration Changes section of the release notes
      in docs/release-notes/README-(version) for all versions between your
      original version and the new version. You may need to manually add
      new items to your config.inc.php file.



Upgrading the Harvester2 database
---------------------------------

After obtaining the latest Harvester2 code, an additional script must be run to
complete the upgrade process by upgrading the Harvester2 database and
potentially executing additional upgrade code.

This script can be executed from the command-line or via the Harvester2 web interface.

1. Command-line

If you have the CLI version of PHP installed (e.g., /usr/bin/php), you can
upgrade the database by running the following command from the Harvester2
directory:

    $ php tools/upgrade.php upgrade


2. Web

If you do not have the PHP CLI installed, you can also upgrade by running a
web-based script. To do so:

    - Edit config.inc.php and change "installed = On" to "installed = Off"
    - Open a web browser to your Harvester2 site; you should be redirected to
      the installation and upgrade page
    - Select the "Upgrade" link and follow the on-screen instructions
    - Re-edit config.inc.php and change "installed = Off" back to
       "installed = On"
