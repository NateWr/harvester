About
-----
Harvester2 has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project.
For general information about Harvester2 and other open research systems, visit
the PKP web site at <http://pkp.sfu.ca/>.


License
-------
Harvester2 is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file
docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

Third parties are welcome to modify and redistribute Harvester2 in entirety or
parts according to the terms of this license. PKP also welcomes patches for
improvements or bug fixes to the software.


System Requirements
-------------------
Recommended server requirements:

	* PHP >= 4.2.x (including PHP 5.x); Microsoft IIS requires PHP 5.x
	* MySQL >= 3.23.23 (including MySQL 4.x/5.x)
	* Apache >= 1.3.2x or >= 2.0.4x or Microsoft IIS 6 (untested)
	* Operating system: Any OS that supports the above software, including
	  Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows

As PKP does not have the resources to test every possible combination of
software versions and platforms, no guarantee of correct operation or support
is implied. We welcome feedback from users who have deployed Harvester2 on
systems other than those listed above.


Recommended Configuration
-------------------------

A secure deployment can be best achieved by using the following policies:

	* Dedicate a database to Harvester2; use unique credentials to access
	  it. Configure this database to perform automated backups on a regular
	  basis. Perform a manual backup when upgrading or performing
	  maintenance.

	* Configure Harvester2 (config.inc.php) to use SHA1 hashing rather
	  than MD5.

	* Configure Harvester2 (config.inc.php) to use force_ssl_login so that
	  authenticated users communicate with the server via HTTPS.


Installation
------------
Please review this document and the RELEASE document prior to installing
Harvester2. If you encounter problems, please also see the FAQ document in this directory.

To install Harvester2:

	1. Extract the Harvester2 archive to the desired location in your web documents
	   directory.
	
	2. Make the following files and directories (and their contents)
	   writeable (i.e., by changing the owner or permissions with chown or
	   chmod):
	   
	     * config.inc.php (optional -- if not writable you will be prompted
	       to manually overwrite this file during installation)
	     * public
	     * cache
	     * cache/t_cache
	     * cache/t_config
	     * cache/t_compile
	     * cache/_db
	
	3. Create a directory to store uploaded files (submission files, etc.)
	   and make this directory writeable. It is recommended that this
	   directory be placed in a non-web-accessible location (or otherwise
	   protected from direct access, such as via .htaccess rules).
	   
	4. Open a web browser to <http://yourdomain.com/path/to/harvester2/> and
	   follow the on-screen installation instructions.
	   
	   Alternatively, the command-line installer can be used instead by
	   running the command "php tools/install.php" from your Harvester2
	   directory. (Note: with the CLI installer you may need to chown/chmod the
	   public and uploaded files directories after installation, if the Apache
	   user is different from the user running the tool.)
	   
	   The installer also offers a "manual installation" option that will
	   display the SQL statements necessary to create the Harvester2 database
	   but not execute them.
	 
	5. Recommended additional steps post-installation:
	
	     * Review config.inc.php for additional configuration settings
	     * Review the FAQ document for frequently asked technical and
	       server configuration questions.


Localization
------------
To add support for other languages, the following sets of XML files must be
localized and placed in an appropriately named directory (using ISO locale 
codes, e.g. "fr_FR", is recommended):

	* locale/en_US
	* dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US
	* help/en_US
	* rt/en_US
	* plugins/[plugin category]/[plugin name]/locale, where applicable

The only critical files that need translation for the system to function
properly are locale/en_US and dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US.

New locales must also be added to the file registry/locales.xml, after which
they can be installed in the system through the site administration web
interface.
	
Translations can be contributed back to PKP for distribution with future
releases of Harvester2.

Server requirements for full Unicode (UTF-8) support:

	* MySQL >= 4.1.1 or PostgreSQL >= 7.1
	* PHP >= 4.3.0 compiled with support for the mbstring library


Third-party Libraries
---------------------
	* See lib/libraries.txt for a list of third-party libraries used by
	  Harvester2.
